Welcome to the Cyclistic Bike Data Analytics project! This analysis was conducted in early August to uncover insightful trends and patterns between annual members and casual riders of Cyclistic, a prominent bike-rental company.

## Project Overview

Cyclistic provided us with a rich dataset spanning a specific period, allowing us to delve deep into user behaviors, preferences, and usage patterns. By utilizing R programming, we performed a comprehensive analysis aimed at shedding light on various aspects of bike-sharing.

## Goals

Our primary goals for this project were to explore user behavior, identify trends, and generate insights that could assist Cyclistic in improving its services, marketing strategies, and user experience.

## Contents

- `data`: Raw data files provided by Cyclistic.
- `scripts`: R scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Running the Analysis

To replicate this analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `scripts` directory and run the R scripts sequentially in your preferred R environment.
3. Visualizations and summaries will be generated.

## Dependencies

This project relies on R packages including `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, and `dplyr`. Make sure you have these packages installed before running the scripts.
